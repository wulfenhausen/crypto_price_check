This CLI accesses data from https://api.coingecko.com and gives users the ability to search for different cryptocurrencies and retrieve either a description of what the cryptocurrency is or its current price.

Once the program has started, the user types in the name of the cryptocurrency they are looking to research. If no result is found in the CoinGecko API, then the program will notify that "Crypto not listed on Coin Gecko. Don't get scammed!"

If the user enters in a coin that is listed in the CoinGecko API, the system will provide the user a list of options. They press 1 for a description of the cryptocurrency. They can press 2 for the  price. If they'd like to search another cryptocurrency, they can type 3. Once they are done research the prices and descriptions of different cryptocurrencies, then can type 4 to exit the program.
